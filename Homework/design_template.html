Each design principle needs four items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- The site name used in the picture
4- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed!

            <h2>Proximity &mdash; Zachary Smith </h2>
            <img src="../images/Scape.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use">

            </p>
            <p>
                This website to me is a great example of Proximity. It has used white space effectively, and the groupings seem to make sense. They have the main purpose of the site in the middle taking up a large amount of space. The login is easy to find and they make it organized and group all the wanted sections of the site at the top.

            <h2>Alignment &mdash;<!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for proximity --> </h2>
            <img src="" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
            <p>
                <!-- Replace this comment with the web site name shown in the image -->
            </p>
            <p>
                <!-- Replace this comment with the copy (text) explaining how alignment is being used in the image. -->
            </p>

            <h2>Repetition &mdash; Daz Buttars</h2>
            <img src="../images/TheArtOfManlinessRepetition.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
            <p>
                The Art of Manliness
            </p>
            <p>
                This site is a great example of Repetition. It uses the same font on all of its pageâ€™s heads and body text as well as a vintage theme in the photographs used to go along with the articles.
