            <h2>Peer Review &mdash; Zachary Smith</h2>
            <p>Zach said that every thing looked "solid," his only suggestion was that he was some what sure that we needed to make the wireframe for all three areas on the same page and that I might want to adapt it more to meet that requirement, but that I had the overall gist. As of now I have not changed anything based on Zach’s feedback however I am going to ask what exactly is required of the page on Monday and I will make changes if needs be after class.</p>
