            <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs four items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- The site name used in the picture
4- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed!

            <h2>Proximity &mdash; Zachary Smith </h2>

            <p>
                This website to me is a great example of Proximity. It has used white space effectively, and the groupings seem to make sense. They have the main purpose of the site in the middle taking up a large amount of space. The login is easy to find and they make it organized and group all the wanted sections of the site at the top.
            </p>

            <h2>Alignment &mdash; Fekadu Haile </h2>
            <img src="../images/Skype.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
            <p>
                Skype.com
            </p>
            <p>
                We know that getting alignment right is one of those really important things that can help to enhance an experience for the user. We can see that in this website the alignments are put in the right order. There is a picture of a mom with a child and the text tells us we can be connected with our families for free. When we see the pictures at bottom, both of the pictures are at left and the text descriptions are at right. That shows how it is aligned and calls the interest of the audience. . So since skype has a proper alignment designs, it will make the audience visually more appealing and will also make it easier for users to scan over a page, sub-consciously also offering a calmer reading experience.

            <h2>Repetition &mdash; Daz Buttars</h2>
            <img src="../images/TheArtOfManlinessRepetition.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
            <p>
                The Art of Manliness
            </p>
            <p>
                The Art of Manliness webpage is a good example of Repetition, it uses the same font and color on all of its page’s heads and body text as well as a vintage theme in the photographs used to go along with the articles. This helps the user to see the sites mission statment.

            <h2>Contrast &mdash; Garret Hauser</h2>
            <img src="../images/HuffingtonPost.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
            <p>
                Huffington Post
            </p>
            <p>
                When you open the Huffington Post mobile site, it is very easy to distinguish between the top news stories of the day and the occasional add that pops up as you scroll through. The titles of the multiple stories are easy to distinguish amongst one another because of the subtle dividing lines. Pictures that aren’t outrageous and compliment the stories they are telling. The stories themselves are written in the same black font against a white background, which makes them easily readable and easy to navigate. They bring what seems to be the most up to date stories and the colors overall are simple but sophisticated.

            <h2>Typography &mdash; Scott Croft</h2>
            <img src="../images/CNN.PNG" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
            <p>
                CNN.com
            </p>
            <p>
                Typography was shown well when looking at this website. CNN had designed it so that it would follow a more personalized approach when displaying its material. This is why they followed a linear form of layout when you arrive at the site. You would see the Breaking News first as well as a picture. Then they would give you links to the other recent stories of the week after the movie. It would then end with a vertical version of the bottom of the page, complete with links back the US and National editions as well as an About Us section as well. I wasn’t lost when reading the news and the Layout was easy to follow.
